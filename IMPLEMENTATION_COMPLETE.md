# 🎉 Event Page Redesign - Complete!

## ✅ Changes Successfully Applied

### 1. **Routing System Updated**
- ✅ Changed from UUID-based (`/events/06a9d636-c1e6-4a65-86ef-b6f4f40dda98`) to idx-based (`/events/0`)
- ✅ Updated `src/app/events/page.tsx` - Event list now links using `event.idx`
- ✅ Updated `src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx` - Event detail page now finds events by `event.idx`

### 2. **New Stripe-Inspired Minimal Design**
✅ Complete redesign from glassmorphism to clean, minimal white design
✅ Sticky header with "Back to Events" link
✅ Two-column layout: Event details (left) + Sticky form (right)
✅ Event poster displayed prominently in center with `object-contain`
✅ Multi-step registration form (Details → Payment → Success)
✅ Clean typography with proper hierarchy

## 🔗 Example URLs

Access your events with clean URLs:

  `http://localhost:3000/events/3`

## 🚀 How to Test

1. Start your dev server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the events page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/events
   ```

3. Click on any event to see the new design

4. Test the registration form:
   - Fill in details
   - Proceed to payment
   - Upload screenshot
   - Complete registration

## 💡 Technical Details

### Sticky Form Implementation:
```tsx
<div className="sticky top-24 space-y-6">
  {/* Form content */}
</div>
```

### Event Lookup by Index:
```tsx
const eventData = events.find(event => event.idx === parseInt(id as string));
```

### Event Poster Display:
```tsx
<div className="relative aspect-video rounded-2xl overflow-hidden bg-gray-100 border border-gray-200">
  <Image
    src={event.image}
    alt={event.title}
    fill
    className="object-contain"
    priority
  />
</div>
```

## 🎨 Customization Guide

Want to tweak the design? Here are the key classes to modify:

### Colors:
- Primary CTA: `bg-black hover:bg-gray-800`
- Borders: `border-gray-200`
- Text: `text-gray-900` (headings), `text-gray-600` (body)

### Spacing:
- Main container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-12`
- Grid gap: `gap-12`
- Form spacing: `space-y-4`

### Typography:
- H1: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold`
- H2: `text-2xl font-semibold`
- Body: `text-sm` or `text-base`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Events not loading
- Check that `events_local.json` has `idx` field for each event
- Verify the event idx matches the URL parameter

### Issue: Form not sticky
- Check that parent container doesn't have `overflow-hidden`
- Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured

### Issue: Images not showing
- Check image paths in `events_local.json`
- Verify images exist in `public` directory
