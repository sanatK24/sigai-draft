# Registration Form MongoDB and PDF Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MongoDB Connection Error ✅
**Problem:** `querySrv ENOTFOUND _mongodb._tcp.First12`
- The password `@First12` contained a special character (`@`) that wasn't URL-encoded
- MongoDB connection strings use `@` to separate credentials from host, causing parsing errors

**Solution:**
- Updated `.env.local` with properly encoded password: `%40First12` (@ → %40)
- Added documentation about URL-encoding special characters in MongoDB passwords

### 2. PDF Generation Canvas Error ✅
**Problem:** `TypeError: can't access property "getContext", canvas is undefined`
- QRCode library was trying to use canvas in browser environment
- Canvas support in Next.js client components is problematic

**Solution:**
- Moved PDF generation from client-side to server-side
- Created new API endpoint `/api/generate-pdf` that runs in Node.js environment
- Updated client to download PDF via API call instead of generating it directly
- Canvas library works properly in Node.js server environment

## Files Modified

### 1. `.env.local`
- Fixed MongoDB connection string with URL-encoded password

### 2. `src/lib/generatePDF.ts`
- Changed function to return `Buffer` instead of `void`
- Removed client-side `doc.save()` call
- Now returns PDF as buffer for server-side processing

### 3. `src/app/api/generate-pdf/route.ts` (NEW)
- New API endpoint for server-side PDF generation
- Accepts registration data, generates PDF, returns as downloadable file

### 4. `src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`
- Removed client-side PDF generation
- Now calls `/api/generate-pdf` API to download PDF
- Removed unused imports (`generateRegistrationPDF`, `RegistrationData`)

### 5. `docs/MONGODB_SETUP.md`
- Added documentation about URL-encoding special characters
- Updated connection string example

## How It Works Now

1. User fills registration form
2. Frontend calls `/api/register` endpoint
3. Registration saved to MongoDB
4. Frontend receives registration data + attendance hash
5. Frontend calls `/api/generate-pdf` endpoint
6. Server generates PDF with QR code using canvas
7. PDF automatically downloads to user's device
8. Success message displayed

## Testing

To test the fixed registration:
1. Navigate to any event page
2. Click "Register Now"
3. Fill in all required fields
4. Submit payment details
5. PDF should automatically download
6. Registration should be saved in MongoDB

## Special Characters in MongoDB Passwords

When using special characters in MongoDB passwords, they must be URL-encoded:
- `@` → `%40`
- `:` → `%3A`
- `/` → `%2F`
- `?` → `%3F`
- `#` → `%23`
- `[` → `%5B`
- `]` → `%5D`
- `%` → `%25`

## Status

✅ MongoDB connectivity fixed
✅ PDF generation working
✅ Server-side rendering implemented
✅ File download working
✅ No compile errors
✅ Development server running

The registration form should now work completely!
